# Cybersecurity Case Studies
## CVE-2015-1805 Google Android
- This study is about vulnerability CVE-2015-1805 that applied to rooting apps. This fault allows malicious apps to gain “root” access to all Android phones with a below kernel version 3.18.

## Credit Card Breach at Home Depot
- A breach often leads to loss of sensitive data by the companies followed by lawsuits, fines and remediation to prevent the breach in future. This study is about one such breach that happened at Home Depot back in 2014 when Target already had one.

## Security Analysis of FIDO
- The world is rapidly transitioning to passwordless alternatives, using FIDO as the underlying security mechanism. Accordingly, we examined the FIDO cryptosystem in order to understand its current and future security properties, and potential attack vectors of the protocol. With advancements in quantum computers, theoretical analysis has revealed the intractable properties of factoring and elliptic curve addition (on classical computers) are easily solved with quantum computers. Fortunately, new quantum resistant algorithms are emerging, but creating new challenges of migrating to the new algorithms. While significantly more secure than password only systems, FIDO systems are still not immune to attack.
